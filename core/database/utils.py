def varput(subject_or_session_id, variable, value, **kwargs):
    """
    Sets variables (custom or otherwise) of a session or subject in a MBI-XNAT
    project

    User credentials can be stored in a ~/.netrc file so that they don't need
    to be entered each time a command is run. If a new user provided or netrc
    doesn't exist the tool will ask whether to create a ~/.netrc file with the
    given credentials.

    Parameters
    ----------
    subject_or_session_id : str
        Name of subject or session to set the variable of
    variable : str
        Name of the variable to set
    value : str
        Value to set the variable to
    user : str
        The user to connect to the server with
    loglevel : str
        The logging level to display. In order of increasing verbosity
        ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG.
    connection : xnat.Session
        An existing XnatPy session that is to be reused instead of
        creating a new session. The session is wrapped in a dummy class
        that disables the disconnection on exit, to allow the method to
        be nested in a wider connection context (i.e. reuse the same
        connection between commands).
    server : str | int | None
        URI of the XNAT server to connect to. If not provided connect
        will look inside the ~/.netrc file to get a list of saved
        servers. If there is more than one, then they can be selected
        by passing an index corresponding to the order they are listed
        in the .netrc
    use_netrc : bool
        Whether to load and save user credentials from netrc file
        located at $HOME/.netrc
